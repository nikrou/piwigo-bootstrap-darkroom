### Development & Customizing

-   All stylesheets are compiled from Bootstrap's Sass source files using node-sass.
-   Dependencies are managed using npm.
-   To install build dependencies, use

```
npm install
```

The build process is based on npm scripts and uses common shell functions, so it might not work on Windows.

To build everything, use

```
npm run build
```

To build only bootswatch, for example, use

```
npm run build:bootswatch
```

See [package.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikrou/simple-responsive/master/package.json) for available script commands.

There is built-in support for a custom Sass build.

-   Create the file _scss/custom/custom.scss_
-   Include all required Boostrap stuff in there, override variables as you wish, just like any custom bootstrap build
-   Compile with `npm run build:custom`
-   Select "Custom" style in the theme's configuration
